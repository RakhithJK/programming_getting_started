# Part 0: Introduction and Getting Started

## Introduction
Programming and automation are great tools for any IT or security engineer (or anyone wanting to finish their tasks automagically!). They allow you to build new tools or to combine already existing tools. These tools can improve and speed up already existing IT and security tasks. 

The goal for this documentation is to help introduce people who are interested in learning more about programming and automation. I’m not looking to teach someone how to be a professional developer, but looking to help encourage and grow new hackers, tinkerers, and builders. I’m looking to provide the tools and direction to inspire curiosity and passion.

Most importantly, stay focused on continued learning. Keeping your skills sharp by programming frequently and always looking for new things to automate. Don't get discouraged when something doesn't work perfectly, coming back to a project later may expose a new way to solve a problem.

## Getting Started
### How to pick a programming language - Right tool for the job
Rather than suggest a language or two without providing any reasoning, I'd like to give a few ways to determine what the right language for the job might be.

* Existing knowledge and urgency - Depending on the urgency of the task your trying to complete, sometimes it might be best to use a language you're already familiar with. If you have the time and desire to learn a new language, now might be the time to try and pick it up, if the task isn't too complex.

* Community Support - Some projects or communities have a tendency to lean towards a specific languages. For example, many of the infosec community projects use Python or Ruby. IT and DevOps have started to use a lot of Go. You're not required to use the same language as your peers, but depending on your goal and other programs you might be leveraging, it might make life easier. When teams are all "speaking the same language" it makes coordination easier as well. This might be a great chance to pick up another programming language though!

* System Support - Another important thing to consider is whether the systems you’ll be running the code on supports the language you’re using. For example, many Linux systems support both Python2.7 and Python3, but some systems will default to a particular version. Some systems may require extra software to execute the code you have written, so make sure you have the permissions (and ability) to install supporting software.

### Programming environment configuration - Python and Go
Python and Go are the two languages I enjoy the most, so I’ll be using these in my examples moving forward. Below are links to environment setup guides for each of these languages.
