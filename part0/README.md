# Part 0: Introduction and Getting Started

Programming and automation are great tools for any IT or security engineer (or anyone wanting to finish their tasks automagically!). They allow you to build new tools or to combine already existing tools. These tools can improve and speed up already existing IT and security tasks. 

The goal for this documentation is to help introduce people who are interested in learning more about programming and automation. I’m not looking to teach someone how to be a professional developer, but looking to help encourage and grow new hackers, tinkerers, and builders. I’m looking to provide the tools and direction to inspire curiosity and passion.
