# Part 1 - Problem Solving: How to approach a problem with programming
Each of the follow examples will show my thought process behind solving a problem as well as the code related to solving problems. Each example will a problem that you might commonly run into in your day to day work. Each example will attempt to include:

* Any development steps
* Common missteps, or things that caught me off guard
* Every programming language supported by these guides
* The thought process on working with the data provided
* The thought process around which libraries to use, if any
* The thought process of how to present or store the data, if applicable
